# text-based-rpg

---

this is my fourth project submission for the athena challenge on hackclub. for this one i wanted to make something awesome and fun using a language im not very good at. i landed on python as the language and decided to make a text based adventure game, similar to some of the older computer games. this has taken me a long time to get running, but its been one of the funnest projects i think ive ever done. :)
